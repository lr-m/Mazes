# Maze_Generation
Visualisation of various maze generation algorithms, as well as solvers. Plus a maze benchmarker.

TODO:
- Add makefile for the Maze_Tester program
- Add READMEs
- Convert maze generator to command line
- General visual improvements with analysis and visualisation

### Maze_Visualisation:
- Contains the  application, download and run the .exe to see the Maze Visualisation application.
- Contains the source code for the application, written in Java/Processing.

### Maze_Generator
- Generates mazes that are exported to folders within the data folder to be analysed by the Script and Maze_Tester program.
- May change to a command line variant rather than using the GUI.

### Maze_Tester
- Contains a simple C program that produces benchmarks of mazes passed as text files, performs a depth first search that scans over the entire maze, collecting information about the maze such as number of dead ends.

### Scripts
- Contains the script that iterates over the mazes generated by the generators program and applies the Maze_Tester program in order to create the dataset used in the analysis/visualisation.

### Maze_Analysis
- Using the data from the previously described components, a visualisation is created to compare the mazes output by the various algorithms.
