# Maze_Generation
Visualisation of various maze generation algorithms, as well as solvers. Plus a maze benchmarker.

TODO:
- Add makefile for the Maze_Tester program
- Add READMEs and usage
- Convert maze generator to command line
- General visual improvements with analysis and visualisation

### Maze_Visualisation:
- Contains the  application, download and run the .exe to see the Maze Visualisation application.
- Contains the source code for the application, written in Java/Processing.

### Maze_Generator
- Generates mazes that are exported to folders within the data folder to be analysed by the Script and Maze_Tester program.
- May change to a command line variant rather than using the GUI.

### Maze_Tester
- C program that solves a passed maze, mazes are passed as text files in the form:
```
  #########
  #-----#-#
  ###-#-#-#
  #---#---#
  #-#####-#
  #-#---#-#
  #-#-#-###
  #---#---#
  #########
  ```
- Where '#' represents a wall and '-' represents an empty square.
- The example maze is a 9x9 maze, example of program call:

```gcc main.c agent.c hash.c stack.c -o solve```
```./solve "maze.txt" 9 9 1 1 7 7 v```

- This use case would provide the following output:

```
Arguments:
Filename: maze.txt
Number of Columns: 9
Number of Rows: 9
Start Coordinates: [ 1, 1 ]
End Coordinates: [ 7, 7 ]

Imported Maze:

Solution:
[1, 1] -> [2, 1] -> [3, 1] -> [3, 2] -> [3, 3] -> [2, 3] -> [1, 3] -> [1, 4] -> [1, 5] -> [1, 6] -> [1, 7] -> [2, 7] -> [3, 7] -> [3, 6] -> [3, 5] -> [4, 5] -> [5, 5] -> [5, 6] -> [5, 7] -> [6, 7] -> [7, 7]

Analysis Summary:
Left-First Solver Iterations: 42
Right-First Solver Iterations: 20
Solution Length: 21
```

### Scripts
- Contains the script that iterates over the mazes generated by the generators program and applies the Maze_Tester program in order to create the dataset used in the analysis/visualisation.

### Maze_Analysis
- Using the data from the previously described components, a visualisation is created to compare the mazes output by the various algorithms.
